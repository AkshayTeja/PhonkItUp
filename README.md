## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to get your project up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: (LTS version recommended, e.g., 18.x or 20.x) - The JavaScript runtime environment.
- pnpm: (Performant Node.js Package Manager) - Used for installing and managing project dependencies. You can install it globally via npm:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
- Supabase Project: An active Supabase project with your database, authentication, and storage configured. You will need your Supabase Project URL and Public API Key (Anon Key) for the .env file. If you haven't set one up, you can do so at supabase.com.

### Installation Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AkshayTeja/PhonkItUp.git
  cd PhonkItUp
  ```

2. **Environment Configuration**

  **Create a `.env.local` file:** Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project directory (where `package.json` is located) and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase project credentials.

  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY
  # If you have any other environment variables, add them here.
  # For example, if you need a service role key for server-side operations (be cautious with this in client-side code):
  # SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
  ```

> **Note:** You can find your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your Supabase project dashboard under **Project Settings > API**.

3. **Installation & Running**

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. **Run the development server:**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application should now be running in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

After launching the application:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
2. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials.
3. Browse the website for songs of your liking
4. Add items to your Phonkits, play songs, customise profile and keep exploring


## ü§ù Contributing
